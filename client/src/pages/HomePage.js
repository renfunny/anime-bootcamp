                      20th Century Boys is a must read. I've never wanted to
                      uncover the truth behind a cult so badly before. Everytime
                      I thought it couldn't get crazier, it did. Kept my
                      attention the whole time. This is defininetly on par with
                      Naoki Urasawa's "Monster". If you're looking for something to read, you simply cannot
                      go wrong with this series.{" "}

                      parts of the main character's (Thorfinn) life as a viking. 
                      With stunning visuals, intense action sequences, and complex character

                      I've learnt many life lessons through watching Naruto.
                      The themes of friendship and hardwork run deep throughout the main story
                      and character interactions. Each character provides an interesting take on something in life
                      and it's never as simple as one person is bad or one person is good.{" "}

                      Bluelock is an excellent anime to get your feet wet into the world of anime.
                      This show makes an uneventful sport - like football - action-packed, suspenseful 
                      but also makes you want to binge-watch in one sitting.
                      The super powers each character has really makes the style of football fun and entertaining.{" "}

                      Death Note was my first anime and it delivered on everything that was promised to me.
                      Both the main character and "villian" are incredibly smart and it was so much fun watching
                      the two try to out smart one another. If you like crime/investigative shows, this is a must watch{" "}

                      It's over 8000 !!! As an old school guy, I strongly recommend Dragon Ball, Specially the classic
                      and Z seasons. You can watch multiple seasons without feeling old, because it's just amazing!
                      As much as the fights last several episodes, they are still the best fights ever seen in anime.
                      It's an anime with Humour, fights, family, fights, food, fights and more fights.{" "}
